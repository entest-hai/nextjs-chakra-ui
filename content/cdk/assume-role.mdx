For example, dev account wants to access S3 in prod account.

## CDK Stack

In the prod account create a role and tell who will assume the role. Create this stack (role) in the prod account.

```tsx
const role = new aws_iam.Role(this, 'AssumedRoleByGuestAccount', {
  roleName: 'AssumedRoleByGuestAccount',
  assumedBy: new aws_iam.AccountPrincipal(props.account_id_guest),
  description: 'enable a guest account to access s3'
})
```

attach a policy to tell what this role can do

```tsx
role.attachInlinePolicy(
  new aws_iam.Policy(this, 'PolicyAllowGuestAccountToAccessS3', {
    statements: [
      new aws_iam.PolicyStatement({
        effect: aws_iam.Effect.ALLOW,
        actions: ['s3:*'],
        resources: ['*']
      }),
      new aws_iam.PolicyStatement({
        effect: aws_iam.Effect.ALLOW,
        actions: ['sts:AssumeRole'],
        resources: ['*']
      })
    ]
  })
)
```

take note the role arn and give it to the dev account

```tsx
new CfnOutput(this, 'AssumedRoleByGuesAccount', {
  value: role.roleArn
})
```

## Assume the role

From the dev account, assume the role as a AWSCLI Session

```shell
aws sts assume-role --role-arn "arn:aws:iam:PROD_ACCOUNT_ID:role/AssumedRoleByGuesAccount"
```

Then take note temporary credentials

```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN="AWS_SESSION_TOKEN"
```

Test it

```shell
aws s3 ls
```
